# 2D_Endless_Cube_Runner
A project made by me (Chinmay Pagey 20MIA1112) as part of my GDC 2D workshop

The project is inspired from the famous game Geometry Dash. I have taken the basic idea of a 2D cube game as discussed in the workshop. To that I have added some of my own mechanics like 
-> Player input for jump
-> Background Animation
-> Infinite osbtacle spawner
-> damage from obstacles
